An E-Commerce portal which will allow formal and informal merchants in developing countries to advertise and sell their goods on the internet. This would permit rural communities to make their wares available to the rest of the world via the World Wide Web. The objective of this project is to create an e-commerce web portal with a content management system which would allow product information to be updated securely using a mobile device. The web portal will have an online interface in the form of an e-commerce website that will allow users to buy goods from the merchants.

This project will be divided into following separate components:

The content management system (CMS)
The e-commerce website/portal
The product, merchant and customer database
The coupans, affliates, discount managements
Reporting of the sales, orders, shipments etc
The online transaction security system
